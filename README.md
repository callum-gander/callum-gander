## :computer:  About Me
:house: My name's Callum, I'm a Fullstack Engineer living and working in London. I was previously employed at Ino Creative, a jewellery manufacturing startup based in London, but left in February and am currently looking for something new!

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on SherpaPath, a cross platform app that allows users to describe their goals and the motivations behind them in order build personalised systems to support them in achieving their goals. I'm planning to launch it in mid-April [See here](https://sherpapath.app). I also recently built Mad Alchemist, a fun little app for playing around with the ability of GPT-3.5 to create weird and wonderful experiments [See here](https://sherpapath.app).

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently focusing on learning how to utilise LLMs and tools like LangChain to build complex applications, as well as developing a deeper understanding of AI and tools that help make software more portable, performant and accessible, e.g. Tauri and WebAssembly

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open-source AI tools and technologies that help make code more portable (e.g. Tauri, WebAssembly)

:books: I have a BA History (First Class) from Oxford Brookes University and a MSc Computer Science (First Class) from the University of Nottingham
